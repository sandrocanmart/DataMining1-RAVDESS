# DataMining1-Ravdess
 Project for the exam of Data Mining - Part I Foundation. Dataset available in (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uwrfkaggler/ravdess-emotional-song-audio). The final work is summariezed in a written report, readeable in the repository.



## Project Task 1 
#### Data Understanding and Preparation
1. Data Semantics
2. Disribuion of the variables and statistics
3. Assessing data quality
4. Variable transformations
5. Pairwise correlations and eventual elimination of variables

## Project Task 2
#### Clustering

1. Analysis by centroid-based methods.
2. AAnalysis by density-based clustering.
3. Analysis by hierarchical clustering. 
4. Final Discussion

## Project Task 3
#### Classification

1. Explore and prepare the time series dataset.
2. Preprocess the dataset in order to be able to run time series 
clustering; motif/anomaly discovery and classification. If the dataset is 
too big for these tasks, you can use approximations (e.g. SAX, PAA etc)

#### Motifs/Discords
1. Analyze the dataset for finding motifs and/or anomalies. Visualize and 
discuss them and their relationship with shapelets.

#### Clustering

1. Classification of at least 1 target variable of your choice by:
   - Decision Tree;
   - KNN;
   - Naive Bayes;
2. Discussion


## Project Task 4
#### Pattern Mining
1. Frequent Pattern Extraction
2. Discuss Frequent Pattern
3. Association Rules extraction
4. Discuss Association rules
5. Exokitu the most useful extracted rules
